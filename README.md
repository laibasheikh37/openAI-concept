## MESSAGE
In OpenAI's models, **Messages** refer to the conversation context, which consists of input-output pairs. These allow the user to send messages to the model and receive responses. When using OpenAI's API, you send input messages, and the model provides output messages as a response.
Example:
```golden
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "What is OpenAI?"
}

## MODEL
The **Model** refers to the specific version of the OpenAI language model that you want to interact with, such as gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4. Each model has different capabilities and behavior.
**Example**
golden
{
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
