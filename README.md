1. ## MESSAGE
In OpenAI's models, **Messages** refer to the conversation context, which consists of input-output pairs. These allow the user to send messages to the model and receive responses. When using OpenAI's API, you send input messages, and the model provides output messages as a response.
**Example:**
  {
  "role": "user",
  "content": "What is OpenAI?"
  }

2. ## MODEL
   The **Model** refers to the specific version of the OpenAI language model that you want to interact with,such as gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4. 
   Each model has different capabilities and behavior.
**Example:**
   {
  "model": "gpt-4"
   }
 
3. ## Max Completion Tokens
   **Max Completion Tokens** defines the maximum length of the response generated by the model. This value helps in controlling the output length. The model will stop generating text once this token limit is reached.
**Example:** 
   {
  "max_tokens": 100
   }

4. ## n (Number of Responses)
   The **n parameter** allows you to specify how many responses the model should generate for the same input. For example, setting n=3 means the model will generate three different outputs.
**Example:**
   {
  "n": 3
   }

5. ## Stream
  **Stream** allows you to receive the model's response in real-time, as it is being generated. Setting stream=true sends partial responses as the model is processing.
**Example:**
   {
  "stream": true
   }

6. ## Temperature
   The **Temperature parameter** controls the randomness of the model's output:
  - A higher value (e.g., 0.7) makes the output more random and creative.
  - A lower value (e.g., 0.2) makes the output more focused and deterministic.
**Example:**
   {
  "temperature": 0.7
   }

7. ## Top_p
  **Top_p** (nucleus sampling) controls the diversity of the output by considering the smallest set of likely next tokens with a cumulative probability above top_p. Lower values make the output more deterministic.
**Example:**
   {
  "top_p": 0.9
   }

8. ## Tools
  **Tools** refers to any external capabilities integrated with OpenAI's API, such as browsing the web or running code. You can use these tools to extend the modelâ€™s abilities beyond simple text generation.
**Example:**
   {
  "tools": ["code-interpreter", "browser"]
   }
